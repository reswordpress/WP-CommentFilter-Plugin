CommentFilter Plugin for WordPress
==================

A simple censorship filter for wordpress that works with comments and e-commerce product reviews! Lets you decide what to swap the words with. Doesn't change the actual comments in the database, but replaces words before they are rendered on a page using wordpress hooks/filters. A settings panel lets you add and remove rules easily.

This plugin works for comment text, so a review on an e-commerce(let's say woocommerce) product page will also be filtered.

Things I could still add:
Regex support
Prettier options_page UI
