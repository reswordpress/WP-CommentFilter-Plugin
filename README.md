CommentFilter Plugin for WordPress
==================

A plugin that filters comments on WordPress. Uses a filter/hook to swap any word with another. The changes are only made before being displayed on the page and do not alter the database.

The UI could be prettier.

Things I could still add:
Regex support
Prettier options_page UI
