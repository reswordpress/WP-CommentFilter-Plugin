CommentFilter Plugin for WordPress
==================

A plugin that filters comments on WordPress. Uses a filter/hook to swap any word with another. The changes are only made before being displayed on the page and do not alter the database.

Quick sloppy code. Working UI.
The UI could definitely be prettier.

Things I could still add:
Regex support
Prettier options_page UI
