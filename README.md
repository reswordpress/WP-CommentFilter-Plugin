wp_commentfilter
==================

A plugin that filters comments on WordPress. Uses a filter/hook to swap any word with another. The changes are only made before being displayed on the page and do not alter the database.

Quick sloppy code. UI is nonexistant atm. Changes to DB must be done manually for now.
